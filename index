        <p>My name is Chris Diffie I am new to the coding world but very excited to give it my all. In my spare time away from learning I like to go airsofting with my friends and lots of drawing while listening to some music.</p>

        <h1>My Background</h1>

        <p> I don't have much backgroung in coding but I am learning all I can about it, I did three year of JROTC at Shadow Mountain High School in the hopes to join the military as a programer. I am mostly self taught in my computer and coding knowledge. </p>

        <h1>Why Programming?</h1>

        <p>I found a passion in programming throughout my love of knowing how things work. I have always taken things apart to see how they work and to put them back together to test myself. Programming is something i have always wanted to learn, to know how everything works. </p>
